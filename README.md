# Graph
Uses original classes to create json graph data

Pass a city and state to Graph test, e.g. Adelanto California, and it will print a graph in json format.
Compare this string to the first graph in graphs.html. If we can read in the json string and store it in
a javascript variable, then we can dynamically create Plotly graphs. 

Someone other than me should integrate that and make sure it works. I will finish the graph functionality 
once someone verifies it is working for the first graph, I believe this will require either jquery or angularjs.
